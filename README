NAME
    Acme::Everything - Effectively loads every class in CPAN

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Everything;

        Any::Module->any_method;

DESCRIPTION
    Acme::Everything is the ultimate run-time loader. With one 'use' line,
    you effectively load all 20,000,000 odd lines of code in CPAN.

    Run ANY method in ANY class, and Acme::Everything will download and/or
    load the module as needed at runtime, including its recursive
    installation dependencies, and every class all the way up the @ISA path
    as needed.

    For all of this, Acme::Everything is implemented in only 13 lines of
    code, by using CPANPLUS and linking parasitically into Class::Autouse
    'superloader'.

    The only restriction is that Acme::Everything will ONLY work when
    calling as a method. Calling as a function will not cause the magic to
    happen.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Acme-Everything>
